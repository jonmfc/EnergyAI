# HackDavis2023 EnergyAIDavis

Our Project is called EnergyAI

**Description:**
We successfully developed a machine learning model capable of forecasting future energy consumption. By leveraging pre-estimated population data, county statistics, and historical energy usage, we created a predictive tool that enables us to gain valuable insights into future energy requirements. This innovative approach has proven instrumental in our efforts to tackle the escalating energy consumption crisis. With this knowledge in hand, we are better equipped to plan strategically and combat wasteful energy practices, safeguarding our precious resources. By doing so, we strive to create a bright future where subsequent generations can thrive in a joyful and sustainable world.
